## Attendance
- There is not a traditional "attendance". We will have regular in-class quizes to check attendance. The intent for this is to assess your knowledge of the material and hold you accountable for attending.

## Group Project
- Everyone in this class is expected to explore some special topics in information security beyond the content of this class (or an extension of what is covered in class).
- It is expected to be done by 2-3 people groups (no larger than 3). 
- The topic of the project can be:
   - A cool demo of applying information security in real world applications.
   - A nice introduction towards new emerging security topics (e.g., blockchain, decentralized computing, differential privacy, stenography, cloud encryption, zero-knowlodge proof, LLM security etc.)
   - An interesting project demonstrates the importance of protecting information security.

## Late Submission Policy
- All assignments are due on the due date at 11:59 pm (EST).
- Students can submit late with the penalty of 10% deduction for every 24 hours late (up to 4 days).
- After 4 days, no more late submission is allowed.
- Extensions can be granted for special cases (email the instructor)


## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT
Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.

Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.

## DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION STATEMENT
Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. Student Disability Resources (SDR) website provides contact information for every Penn State campus
(http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/disability-coordinator). For further information, please visit Student Disability Resources website
(http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/).

In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation: See documentation guidelines
(http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/guidelines). If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.

## COUNSELING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES STATEMENT
Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional wellbeing. The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings. These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity and sexual orientation.
